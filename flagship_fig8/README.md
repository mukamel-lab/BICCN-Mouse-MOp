- Lab of Prof. Eran Mukamel, emukamel@ucsd.edu

The .ipynb notebooks contain code to regenerate the exact figure panels:
- ```fig8_a_c.ipynb```
- ```fig_e.ipynb```

The .py scripts contain utility functions used in the notebooks:
- ```__init__.py```
- ```utils.py```
- ```snmcseq_utils.py```

The data_ folders contains the processed data used (cell-by-gene matrices, dataset level metadata, cell level metadata, etc.):
- ```./data_11mods_it``` (11 datasets generated by BICCN, only excitatory IT cells from each dataset are included)
- ```./data_2mods_exc_mop_visp``` (2 datasets--SMART-seq from MOp ([Yao et al. 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.970558v2)) and VISp ([Tasic et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0654-5)))

Integration results, including the analysis of this figure as pre-generated by SingleCellFusion and analyses from the companion paperï¼ˆYao et al. 2020), are located in the following folders:
- ```./ref```
- ```./results```

You can also regenerate the integration results by running [SingleCellFusion](https://github.com/mukamel-lab/SingleCellFusion) yourself with the data in this folder and the configuration files in the following folder:
(Expect some changes to the embedding shapes because of random intial seeds).
- ```./scf_configs```
